### Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/inception.git
   cd inception

2. **Set up environment variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project to store sensitive data such as database credentials and domain names. The `.env` file should look like this:
    ```env
    DOMAIN_NAME=yourdomain.com
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password

3. **Start the services**  
    Run the following command to start the multi-container environment:  
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
## üîß Configuration

- **Nginx**: Configuration for the reverse proxy is available in the `nginx` directory.  
  You can modify the `nginx.conf` file to adjust server settings or add additional configuration for your environment.

- **MariaDB**: The database credentials are set in the `.env` file. Modify the `.env` file to adjust the database user, password, and other settings like database name.

- **WordPress**: The WordPress configuration is handled automatically via environment variables in the `.env` file. You can customize the database and admin settings by editing the relevant values in the `.env` file.
